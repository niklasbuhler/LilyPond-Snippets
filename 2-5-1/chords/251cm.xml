  Every snippet is represented by:
    title:      title text
    shortcuts:  list of shortcut elements, every shortcut is a key sequence
    body:       the snippet text

  The snippet id attribute can be the name of a builtin snippet or a random
  name like 'n123456'. In the latter case, the title is used to determine
  whether a snippet is new or updated.
